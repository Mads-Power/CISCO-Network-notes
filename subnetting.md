# Subneting notes

## CIDR CLASSLESS Inter-Domain Routing

- CIDR removed the fixed /8, 16 and /24 requrements for the address classes, and allowed them to be split or subnetted into smaller netwowrks.
- f.eks 175.10.10.0/20
- companies can now be allocated and address range which more closly matches their needs and does not waste addresses

## Default subnets of classes

- Class **A** Default = /8
- Class **B** Default = /16
- Class **C** Default = /24
